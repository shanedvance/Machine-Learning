# MachineLearning

Various Machine Learning projects that include:

* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  * Multilayer perceptron (MLP)
  * Predictive Coding Network (PCN)
  * Radial Basis Function (RBF)
* k-means clustering
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Genetic Algorithm (GA)
* Backpropagation

For many of these projects C++ and Python were used.
Utilizing packages such as scikit-learn, numpy, and several other libraries.
